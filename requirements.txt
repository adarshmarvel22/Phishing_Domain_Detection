-e .

# It instructs the package manager (such as pip) to install the project in editable mode, allowing 
# you to make changes to the project's code and have those changes immediately reflected without 
# reinstalling the package.

# By including -e . in the requirements.txt file, you can ensure that when someone installs the 
# project's dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, the current project is included and 
# installed in editable mode.
