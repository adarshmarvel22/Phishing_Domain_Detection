<h1 align="center">Phishing Domain Detection</h1>

This repository contains code for a project that analyzes the features of URLs and domains and predicts whether they are safe or malicious. The project aims to identify and detect malicious URLs and domains commonly associated with phishing attacks.

## Deployed Website link:
[https://www.phishing-domain-detector.com](http://high-env.eba-anerfymt.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

## Features

The project includes the following features:

* Identification of malicious URLs and domains
* Analysis of the features of URLs and domains
* Visualization of the results of the analysis

## Problem Statement

Phishing is a type of fraud in which attackers impersonate reputable companies or individuals to deceive users and obtain sensitive information such as login credentials or account details. The goal of this project is to predict whether domains are real or malicious, helping users identify potential phishing attempts.

## Data
The dataset is taken from Mendeley Data: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/72ptz43s9v/1
Out of a total 111 features, 25 most important features were used to train the model.


## Results

The project will output a visualization of the results of the analysis. The visualization will show the distribution of the features of the URLs and domains.
The version 0.0.1 (branch adarsh has an accuracy of 96.88% in predicting malicious domains)
