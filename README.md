# README

This repository contains code for a project that analyzes the features of URLs and domains and predcts whether it is safe or malicious (by percentage). The project is designed to help identify malicious URLs and domains.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

* Identification of malicious URLs and domains
* Analysis of the features of URLs and domains
* Visualization of the results of the analysis

# 📄✏ Problem Statement:
**Brief:** Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or 
person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account 
information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among 
attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears 
to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.
The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.

####

## Data
The dataset is taken from Mendeley Data: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/72ptz43s9v/1
Out of a total 111 features, 25 most important features were used to train the model.


## Results

The project will output a visualization of the results of the analysis. The visualization will show the distribution of the features of the URLs and domains.
The version 0.0.1 (branch adarsh has an accuracy of 96.88% in predicting malicious domains)
